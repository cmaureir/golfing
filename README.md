```

If you don't this is the talk for you :tada:.
(and if you do, maybe you can get some insights too!)

## Content

This repository contains the material
for a talk related to do [code golfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf)
with Python.

There is a quick guide to the basics of [Pyth](https://pyth.readthedocs.io),
and also a couple of real submission on
a challenge from [codegolf.stackexchange.com](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/185872/dad-jokes-are-fun)
called "Dad Jokes" :man_shrugging:.
